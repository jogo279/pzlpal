    <p>PzlPal is a crossword puzzle solver which turns pictures into solved puzzles in under a minute. There are three steps: first you upload a picture of a puzzle (for example, from your newspaper or a website). Next, you help us break the image into components, namely the grid and the clues. Finally, we present the digitized puzzle, where you can make final adjustments and then let us solve your puzzle!</p>
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>PzlPal was originally created for Carnegie Mellon University's yearly hackathon, <a href = "http://tartanhacks.com" target="_blank">TartanHacks</a>. PzlPal won first place in TartanHacks 2014: you can read the <a href = "http://www.carnegiemellontoday.com/issues/july-2014-issue/the-fence/puzzling/" target="_blank">write up</a> in Carnegie Mellon Today. This website is a more fleshed-out version of the <a href = "http://github.com/hpx7/pzlpal" target="_blank">original hack</a>.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>PzlPal is written primarily in NodeJS using the <a href = "http://mean.io" target="_blank">MEAN stack</a>. Image processing is performed using <a href = "http://opencv.org" target="_blank">OpenCV</a>, and optical character recognition via <a href = "http://newocr.com" target="_blank">NewOCR's API</a> and <a href = "https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract" target="_blank">Tesseract</a>. To solve the puzzles, we first obtain possible answers for each slot by running a full-text search on <a href = "http://www.otsys.com/clue/" target="_blank">Matt Ginzer's Cluer Database</a> using <a href="http://http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank">Apache Solr</a>. We use these answers to fill the grid using a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking" target="_blank">backtracking algorithm</a>, modified somewhat for efficiency. PzlPal is hosted on <a href = "http://digitalocean.com" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>.
